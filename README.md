# Bot Manager

> ### This repository is a work in progress
> Some existing APIs may be changed in the near future as this project is still under active development.

## About
This is the repository for the Bot Manager application which manages and orchestrates game bots. The bots are build on top of the [WebSocket Parser](https://github.com/vingame/websocket-parser) project and is  
specifically tuned for faster integration with games from the Mini Game repository. The Scenario API and the various methods of the Bot class are there to  
make the development as quick and flexible and provide a credible alterative to the current JavaScript based bots with the goal of phasing them out eventually in favor of  
the much more robust and performant Java concurrency model and type safety.
